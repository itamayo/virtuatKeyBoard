Virtual Keyboard with old browser compatibility

# Howto
Just import javascript and css files to the webpage. Associate any input which needs a virtual keyboard by adding *vk* class. Example :

```html
<input type="text" class="vk" id="name">
```
It will show it when the focus is on the input and OK/Enter key is pressed.
